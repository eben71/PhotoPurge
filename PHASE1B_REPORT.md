# Phase 1b Picker Feasibility Report

Status: Draft (run the probes and fill in results)

## Hypotheses

- Picker selection can reach at least 1,000 items with acceptable user friction.
- Selected item listing completes in under 5 minutes for 1,000 items.
- Content URLs are accessible with >= 95% success for sampled items.
- Metadata completeness for critical fields (id, creationTime, baseUrl, filename) is >= 95%.

## Results by Tier

### SMALL (~200 items)
