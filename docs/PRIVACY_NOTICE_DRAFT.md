> **Status:** Draft only. Not final. Not legal advice.
> This document applies to the Phase 2 validation MVP and will be revisited in Phase 3.

## Purpose

PhotoPrune is a validation MVP that analyzes user-selected Google Photos items to identify potential duplicates for review. It is designed to prioritize trust, predictability, and cost control over completeness or automation.

## Data We Access (Phase 2)

- User-selected media items via the Google Photos Picker API.
- Metadata provided by Google Photos (e.g., filename, timestamps, dimensions) when available.

## Data We Do NOT Access (Phase 2)

- Full library scans or non-selected photos.
- Embeddings or semantic representations.

## How We Use Data

- Generate candidate groups of potential duplicates.
- Present review-only results to the user.

## Data Storage & Retention (Draft)

- Data handling details are TBD for Phase 3.
- TODO (Phase 3): Define retention windows and deletion workflows.

## User Controls (Draft)

- Review-only output; no automatic deletion.
- TODO (Phase 3): Add explicit data deletion requests and support workflows.

## Contact

- TODO (Phase 3): Provide support contact and privacy inquiries channel.
